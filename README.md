# disco-button
Disco Button built using CircuitPython, Raspberry Pi Pico Ws, and Adafruit IO

More to come...

Here's what the build looks like for the Button:
Note - these are the exact parts (not acurately shown in Frizing, but wiring is:)
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- Large Arcade Button with LED 60mm White - https://www.adafruit.com/product/1192 (shown below as separate button & LED, but wiring is same)
- Panel Mount 10K potentiometer (Breadboard Friendly) - 10K Linear - https://www.adafruit.com/product/562
- The NeoPixel strip I used has no weatherproof plastic coating & hast 7mm square NeoPixels & 10mm between the LEDs. It may be this one, but also might be some off-brand I bought. Sorry - I don't remember - https://www.adafruit.com/product/1138

Here's what the build looks like for the subscriber (but I intend to break this up with audio & neopixels eventually in separate builds):
